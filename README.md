# Swift for Vim

This is a slightly modified copy of [Apple's swift plugin for Vim](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/master/utils/vim).
Add `Plug 'bassstring/apple-swift` to your config to install it via [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
or any other plugin manager of choice. It offers basic support for syntax highlighting and tab stops.
This plugin also detects [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) for swift.
